# About project
The main goal of this project is to gain experience with major web application technologies such as `microservices`, `RabbitMQ`, `Pusher`, `PostgreSQL`, `AI assistant`, `Vue`, and `Shadcn`.

The core business logic of the project is as follows:  
A user can import a `CSV` file to fill or update the product database.  
An AI assistant analyzes the file and automatically configures the correct import settings based on the fileâ€™s structure.  
The user has a simple dashboard displaying a product table and a form to upload import files.
